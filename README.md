# HiParis

This repository store 2 project described in two jupyter notebooks :

- Test_image
- Test_nlp

The first projet aims to describe a classifaction of a data set of images with Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN). The second project aim to show a code that permit to generate propositions from a text using intelligent methods with LSTM. The two projects are wrote in python 3.10 using tensorflow for the ML algorithms and Pandas,numpy and matplotlib to process and show the data.


# Test_image
We have a image data set of 2000 images of human faces, labelled in 2 categories (0 and 1). We show how to read the data, how to process the data for the ML algorithms and we propose an architecture of CNN and a second model obtained from the famous RedNet50 and, finally, we train model and analyse the accuracy of the model obtained.


# Test_nlp
This code permit to process textual data to generate a LSTM model with keras to generate sentences.
